		<h3>How we started</h3>
		<p>Twas a bright and sunny morning, we were strolling down the street after a glorious night on the town. Everyone was in need of a refreshing pick-me-up but nobody wanted drive. T remembered his Mom's old juicer sitting in his closet. We whipped it out and the rest in history</p>
        <p>The juice started for our own enjoyment. Creating simple, healthy, delicious juices. The combinations range from simple 3 ingredient juices to complex measured out juices that could not be made the same again. As we started selling the juice our method began to progress and we had our fan favorites, standard juices, specific health oriented ones, and of course always gotta have the funky experiments!</p>
        <h3>Beyond the juice</h3>
        <p>The goal is for Momo to stand for more that Momo Juices. The juice is the starting point of inspiration, helping people create, and inspire, taking those risks and steps in life, not being concerned about what could happen if something goes wrong, caring about all the possibilities of what can be done and overcome to make everything go right!</p>
        <p>Momo Juices started because we thought we could make juice that is better than what we could get at a store or a juice bar, and we were right! We took the chance and it payed off. We are now making selling, and delivering juice. We love what we do and we love that we are able to share our passion through each hand made, hand filled, jar of fresh juice. Hoping to pass along a bit of inspiration to push people to their next level. </p>
        <p><strong>Try some juice and go get whatever you've been meaning to do but have been hesitant about!</strong></p>
